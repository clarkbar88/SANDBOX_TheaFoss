## Stormwater:

Oneway tests: csvs are very close but not identical.
Images are essentially identical.
Goodness of fit tests are close but not identical.
Ladder of powers shows slightly different results.
Unable to do a complete run.
Issue is the "cannot be applied to class double, numeric" issue in the cband calculations.
True for both individual and 5y section.

```         
"2-Methylnaphthalene OF245" Error in `map()` at scripts/ci_band_lm_Nov15.R:159:4: ℹ In index: 1. Caused by error in `UseMethod()`: ! no applicable method for 'filter' applied to an object of class "c('double', 'numeric')"
```

## Sediment:

GOF tests break at the cov.wt() at Total PCBs FD-6.
When that compound is removed, the GOF runs.
Same issue on cband calculations for sediment.
Oneway tests are only for Outfall, not by trap.
This is present in the original repository too.
